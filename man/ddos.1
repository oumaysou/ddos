.SH NAME
ddos \- script to mitigate small denial of service attacks.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ddos
[OPTION]
.br
.B ddos
(-k|--kill) <NUMBER_OF_CONNECTIONS>
.br
.B ddos
(-u|--unban) <IP_ADDRESS>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
(D)DoS Deflate is a lightweight bash shell script designed to assist in
the process of blocking a denial of service attack. It utilizes the
command below to create a list of IP addresses connected to the server,
along with their total number of connections. It is one of the simplest
and easiest to install solutions at the software level.

.B ss
-Hntu state connected |
.B awk
\'{print $6}\' |
.B cut
-d: -f1 |
.B sort
|
.B uniq
-c |
.B sort
-nr

.PP
IP addresses with over a pre-configured number of connections are
automatically blocked in the server's firewall, which can be direct
ipfw, iptables, or Advanced Policy Firewall (APF).

.SH WHITELISTING

.PP
It is possible to whitelist IP addresses by adding a
.B new-line
separated list of ip's to /etc/ddos/ignore.ip.list,
you can use IP range syntax and CIDR syntax, for example:

.RS 4
192.168.1.0/24           (CIDR format)
.br
24.12.34.1-24.12.34.30   (IP range)
.br
192.168.1.156            (Single IP)
.RE

.PP
It is also possible to whitelist hostnames by adding a
.B new-line
separated list of hosts to /etc/ddos/ignore.host.list, for example:

.RS 4
googlebot.com
.br
dynamic-ip.somehost.com
.RE

.SH SETTINGS
You can modify the script settings by editing /etc/ddos/ddos.conf

.TP
.B FIREWALL = '<value>'
The firewall to use for blocking/unblocking, valid values are:
auto, apf, csf, ipfw and iptables. (Default: "auto")

.TP
.B EMAIL_TO = '<email>'
An email is sent to the following address when an IP is banned.
Leaving this value empty would suppress sending of mails. (Default: root)

.TP
.B FREQ = <number>
Frequency in minutes for running the script. Every time this setting is
changed, run the script with --cron option so that the new frequency
takes effect. (Default: 1)

.TP
.B DAEMON_FREQ = <number>
Frequency in seconds to monitor connections when running the script
in daemon mode. (Default: 5)

.TP
.B NO_OF_CONNECTIONS = <number>
How many connections define a bad IP? Indicate that below. (Default: 150)

.TP
.B BAN_PERIOD = <number>
Number of seconds the banned ip should remain in blacklist. (Default: 600)

.TP
.B CONN_STATES = '<valid ss states>'
Connection states separated by colon operator (:) to block. See:
.B ss(1).
(Default: "connected")

.TP
.B CONN_STATES_NS = '<valid netstat states>'
Connection states to block separated by pipe operator when using netstat. See:
.B netstat(1).
(Default: "ESTABLISHED|SYN_SENT|SYN_RECV|FIN_WAIT1|FIN_WAIT2|TIME_WAIT|CLOSE_WAIT|LAST_ACK|CLOSING")

.TP
.B ONLY_INCOMING = <false|true>
Only count incoming connections to listening services, which will
prevent the server from banning multiple outgoing connections to
a single ip address. Slower than default in/out method.
(Default: false)

.TP
.B ENABLE_PORTS = <false|true>
This option enables the usage of PORT_CONNECTIONS and overrides the
ONLY_INCOMING option. Same as ONLY_INCOMING but you can also assing
blocking rules per port using PORT_CONNECTIONS. Slower than
ONLY_INCOMING method.
(Default: false)

.TP
.B PORT_CONNECTIONS = '<from_port[-to_port]>:<max_conn>:<ban_period> ...'
Maximum amount of connections per port before blocking. If a user
is making all its connections to a single port the max connections
specified for the port will take precedence over the
NO_OF_CONNECTIONS value.
You should specify a rule for all the service ports your server is
running since those ports not defined on this list will be ignored
when ENABLE_PORTS is enabled, making those ports not listed on this
configuration flag vulnerable to attacks. Example:
"80:150:600 443:150:600 20-21:250:600"

.TP
.B BANDWIDTH_CONTROL = <false|true>
Monitor bandwidth usage per ip and slows down data transfer rate/s if
the BANDWIDTH_CONTROL_LIMIT is exceeded. Requires iftop and tc.
(Default: false)

.TP
.B BANDWIDTH_CONTROL_LIMIT = '<number{kbit|mbit}>'
The data transfer rate/s that triggers a rate drop to the speed
defined in BANDWIDTH_DROP_RATE, can be expressed in mbit or kbit.
(Default: 1896kbit)

.TP
.B BANDWIDTH_DROP_RATE = '<number{kbit|mbit}>'
When the maximum data transfer rate defined in BANDWIDTH_CONTROL_LIMIT
is reached, the speed of the transfer will be reduced to this value
for the amount of seconds specified in BANDWIDTH_DROP_PERIOD.
(Default: 512kbit)

.TP
.B BANDWIDTH_DROP_PERIOD = <number>
The amount of time in seconds to keep a client transfer at the speed
defined on BANDWIDTH_DROP_RATE. (Default: 600)

.TP
.B BANDWIDTH_ONLY_INCOMING = <false|true>
If true, takes into consideration only the data received from
client and not the data sent by server to client. (Default: true)
